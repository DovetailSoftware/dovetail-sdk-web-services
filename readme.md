Dovetail SDK Web Services
=========================

The Web Services were originally provided with Dovetail SDK. Our resources have changed a lot over the years, so we separated the Web Services out into this repo. They are still a good resource, but have been replaced by the examples of RESTful API usage found in [Dovetail Bootstrap](https://github.com/DovetailSoftware/dovetail-bootstrap).

The documentation for the Web Services APIs has been move to GitHub pages, and can be found at [Web Services Documentation](http://dovetailsoftware.github.io/dovetail-sdk-web-services/).
