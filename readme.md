Dovetail SDK Web Services
=========================

The Web Services were originally provided with Dovetail SDK. Our resources have changed a lot over the years, so we separated the Web Services out into this repo. They are still a good resource, but have been replaced by the examples of RESTful API usage found in [Dovetail Bootstrap](https://github.com/DovetailSoftware/dovetail-bootstrap).

The documentation for the Web Services APIs has been included. Once you have cloned this repo, you can open the [Web Services Documentation](docs/html/webframe.html) in your favorite browser.
